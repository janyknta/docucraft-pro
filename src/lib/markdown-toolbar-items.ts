/**
 * The groups, in the order they appear.
 *
 * Everyday actions only. Markdown has plenty more — footnotes, tables,
 * definition lists, admonitions — but a toolbar that offers everything is one
 * nobody can scan, and the reader editing a document is writing prose, not
 * reaching for a table of contents. Anything not here is still one keystroke
 * away in the source, which is the whole point of editing markdown.
 *
 * Grouped by what each action does to the document — inline emphasis, headings,
 * lists, blocks, references — so the row reads as five short lists rather than
 * one wall of fourteen icons.
 *
 * Only shortcuts that are already standard somewhere are offered. Inventing a
 * chord for, say, a horizontal rule buys nothing: nobody would guess it, and
 * the tooltip would be advertising a keystroke the reader has to memorise
 * rather than one they already know.
